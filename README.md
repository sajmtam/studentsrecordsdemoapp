# Students Records Demo App
~~Please note that you will need to create c:/test.txt file for this program to work correctly. The option to do it automatically will be added in the next update.~~ I hope to keep this updated.

The abovementioned feature is now part of the codebase and should work as expected. If a file exists, it is opened for reading, else it is created.

Update: The app no longer requires administrator access to create the file. The location for the same has been shifted from c:/test.txt to the user's "My Documents/test.txt".
